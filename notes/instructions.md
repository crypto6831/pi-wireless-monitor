# Task Instructions

## Overview
I have been assigned to implement a plan described in `@docs/revised-plan.md` for the Pi Wireless Monitor project. This involves creating detailed documentation of my work process and implementation steps.

## My Understanding
1. **Documentation First Approach**: I need to document my understanding, implementation plan, and progress throughout the task
2. **Work in Notes Directory**: All my working notes should be stored in `./notes` for reference and context preservation
3. **Multi-Step Process**:
   - First: Create this instructions file with my understanding
   - Second: Create an implementation.md file detailing how to modify the repository
   - Third: Execute the implementation while maintaining notes

## Current Observations
- The referenced file `docs/revised-plan.md` does not currently exist in the repository
- I will need clarification on the actual plan to implement
- The Pi Wireless Monitor is a distributed WiFi monitoring system with:
  - Raspberry Pi monitors (Python)
  - Backend server (Node.js/Express with MongoDB/Redis)
  - Frontend dashboard (React)
  - Docker deployment on AWS

## Notes for Myself
- Always document changes and reasoning
- Consider impact on all three components when making changes
- Reference CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidelines
- Production runs on AWS at 47.128.13.65
- Cannot test locally - must deploy to AWS for testing
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Use TodoWrite tool to track implementation steps

## Next Steps
1. Wait for clarification on the revised-plan.md content
2. Once plan is available, create detailed implementation.md
3. Break down implementation into manageable steps
4. Document progress and decisions throughout

## Questions
- What is the content of the revised plan that needs to be implemented?
- Are there specific priorities or constraints I should be aware of?
