# Revised Plan for Pi Wireless Monitor

## Overview
This document outlines the revised implementation plan for the Pi Wireless Monitor system to improve its architecture, scalability, and maintainability.

## Current State Analysis
The system currently consists of:
- Multiple Raspberry Pi monitors collecting WiFi data
- Node.js backend server with MongoDB/Redis
- React frontend dashboard
- Docker deployment on AWS

## Revised Architecture Goals

### 1. Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities
- **Real-time Service Monitoring**: Expand beyond WiFi to monitor network services (HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- **Advanced Metrics Collection**: Add latency percentiles, jitter, and packet loss patterns
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implement trend analysis and anomaly detection

### 2. Improved Data Management
- **Time-Series Data**: Migrate metrics to time-series optimized storage
- **Data Retention Policies**: Implement automatic data archival and cleanup
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Add real-time data aggregation for better performance

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Dashboard Customization**: Allow users to create custom dashboard layouts
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Add heatmaps, 3D coverage models, and trend charts
- **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure full functionality on mobile devices

### 4. System Reliability
- **Monitor Health Checks**: Implement heartbeat monitoring for Pi devices
- **Auto-Recovery**: Add automatic service restart on failures
- **Redundancy**: Support multiple backend servers with load balancing

### 5. Security Enhancements
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Role-Based Access**: Implement user roles and permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Track all system changes and access
