- **Frontend Implementation**: Activities Redux slice, enhanced RecentActivity component
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO integration for live activity updates
- **Sample Data**: Auto-generated sample activities on system startup

### ✅ DNS Latency Issue Resolution (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: DNS latency showed "N/A" in Performance Summary
- **Root Cause**: Missing min/max aggregation and hardcoded "N/A" in frontend
- **Solution**: Added real DNS latency measurement with Node.js `dns.resolve4()`
- **Current Status**: Shows real DNS latency (2.31ms - 19.54ms range)
- **Includes**: Mock data generator and real DNS collector scripts

## Recent Bug Fixes (June 2025)

### Authentication Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Dashboard API calls returning 401 errors for location management
- **Solution**: Removed `authenticateMonitor` middleware from dashboard routes

### Redux Location Edit Error Fixed  
- **Problem**: Location editing failed with undefined property errors
- **Solution**: Updated Redux slice and added defensive programming

### Floor Plan Image Loading Fixed
- **Problem**: Floor plan images showing 404 errors
- **Solution**: Improved error handling for missing files vs missing floor plans

### MUI X-Charts Y-Axis Label Visibility Fixed
- **Problem**: Y-axis labels not visible in Channel Analyzer timeline chart
- **Solution**: Custom positioned Typography elements with CSS transforms
